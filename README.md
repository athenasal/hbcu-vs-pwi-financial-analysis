## Analysis Question

Do black students face greater student loan debt when they attend an HBCU or PWI? Using the College Scorecard dataset, I am investigating if HBCUs are a financially better alternative for black students. 

## About the Dataset

The College Scorecard dataset was started by The Obama Administration in 2015. Each row in this dataset contains information about a college in the USA.
The college dataset includes data on a huge range of issues, including:
* location
* demographics
* admission standards
* tuition rates
* graduation rates
* student loans
* outcomes after graduation
* and many more (almost 2000 different variables!)
